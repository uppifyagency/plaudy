# Plaude Local — Agent Handoff (authoritative briefing)

**For the next AI coding agent or developer. Read this first, top to bottom.** It is self‑contained: state, evidence, exact build/run, how to re‑verify everything, the traps that cost real time, the security posture, what's left, and the decisions only a human can make. Deep architecture lives in [CODEBASE.md](CODEBASE.md); line‑cited forensics in [HANDOFF-FASE2.md](HANDOFF-FASE2.md) (diarization) and [HANDOFF-AUTOCAPTURE.md](HANDOFF-AUTOCAPTURE.md) (the 2026‑07‑05 auto‑capture trigger session); the riffado teardown verdict in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

_Snapshot: 2026‑07‑05. Branch `main`. Working tree NOT committed (commit only when asked)._

## 0. Mission & posture (one screen)

**Mission:** Plaude Local = a **local‑first, offline, private** alternative to Plaud (AI voice recorder + "who said what") for macOS, built on the **Handy** fork (Tauri 2, Rust + React). Capture is **on‑device**; ASR + diarization run **locally** (ONNX); **nothing leaves the Mac**. Claude connects to your library through a **local MCP server**.

**Posture today:** the product thesis is **built and proven live**. One click (the menu‑bar ear 👂) records a meeting — your **mic** + the Mac's **system audio** as two streams — and it lands as **one speaker‑attributed transcript** that **Claude can summarize/search locally**. And since 2026‑07‑05 the click is optional: the **seamless auto‑capture trigger works** (per‑process CoreAudio sensor, own PID excluded — E2E‑validated live; still opt‑in, `auto_capture_enabled=false`, pending one real‑meeting validation). Green across the board: **102 Rust unit tests · 2 live‑acceptance tests · 4 MCP tests · `tsc` · ESLint**. A 36 MB optimized **release binary builds**. **2026‑07‑06:** adversarial‑review closure — MCP reads the right DB again (bundle‑id path + WAL/`query_only` open, 14 tests), red now means *recording* only (hero + `Button.primary` → ink‑on‑paper), i18n complete in all 19 languages (+710 keys, orphans purged), `tray_idle_dark.png` is a real dark glyph (`scripts/gen-tray-dark.py`).

**What's NOT done:** a signed/notarized `.app`/`.dmg` (needs full Xcode), true acoustic echo cancellation (only the transcript‑level bleed dup is handled), the iPhone target (needs Xcode), the real‑meeting validation that would let auto‑capture default to on. See §10–§11.

## 1. First 15 minutes (orient fast)

1. **Read:** this file → [CODEBASE.md](CODEBASE.md) (architecture + file map) → skim [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) (what we adopt/drop from riffado).
2. **Build the backend + run tests** (proves your toolchain works):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
   export CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 HANDY_FORCE_AI_STUB=1
   cd handy/src-tauri && cargo test --lib      # expect: 102 passed (+2 ignored)
   cd ../mcp && bun test                         # expect: 4 pass
   ```
3. **Run the app:** `cd handy && bun tauri dev` (leave it running; it regenerates `src/bindings.ts`). Keep an ASR model selected with `unload_timeout ≠ Immediately`.
4. **Smoke‑test the MCP** (what Claude sees), no app needed:
   ```bash
   printf '%s\n' \
     '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{}}}' \
     '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_sessions","arguments":{"limit":5}}}' \
   | bun run handy/mcp/server.ts
   ```
5. **The mental model:** Handy's dictation path is `capture → VAD → transcribe → paste`. We added a **long‑form/meeting** path: `capture (faithful, un‑VAD’d) → stream to disk → (stop) → mix → diarize + transcribe → merge → speaker‑labelled History row → MCP exposes it`.

---

## 2. Exact build, run & test (this machine: Apple Silicon, CLT‑only, no Homebrew/Xcode)

**Every shell needs this prelude** — the toolchain is installed but not on the non‑interactive PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
export CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5   # standalone CMake 4.x rejects pre‑3.5 policy floors (whisper.cpp)
export HANDY_FORCE_AI_STUB=1              # CLT lacks the @Generable macro plugin → Apple Intelligence stub
```
| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Full app (dev) | `cd handy && bun tauri dev` (regenerates `src/bindings.ts` at startup) |
| Backend tests | `cd handy/src-tauri && cargo test --lib` → **102 passed** (+2 ignored live‑acceptance) |
| MCP tests | `cd handy/mcp && bun test` → **4 pass** |
| Type‑check (fast) | `cd handy/src-tauri && cargo check --lib` |
| Frontend type‑check | `cd handy && bunx tsc --noEmit` |
| Frontend lint (i18n enforced) | `cd handy && bun run lint` |
| Release binary | `cd handy && bun tauri build --no-bundle` → `target/release/handy` (≈36 MB, ~6 min). **Signed `.app`/`.dmg` needs full Xcode.** |

Drop `HANDY_FORCE_AI_STUB` once **full Xcode** is installed (also needed for the iPhone target and a real bundle).

**Runtime data:** `~/Library/Application Support/com.uppify.plaudy/` → `history.db` (SQLite) + `recordings/` (`*.session.pcm` live, `*.wav` finalized). **Log:** `~/Library/Logs/com.uppify.plaudy/handy.log`.

## 3. What's DONE — with evidence & confidence

| Capability | Where | Evidence | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mic long‑form sessions (Fase 0) | `managers/session.rs` | live row 11 ("Pronto, pronto…") | High |
| System/loopback audio (Fase 1) | `audio_toolkit/audio/system_audio.rs` (CoreAudio Process Tap) | live row 12 ("Ragazzi, buonasera…") | High |
| Local diarization (Fase 2) | `managers/diarization.rs` + sherpa‑onnx | live rows 9 (2 spk) / 10 (3 spk); `align` unit‑tested | High |
| Per‑row transcript **status** | migration #6, `TranscriptionStatus` | `transcribing → done/failed`; unit‑tested | High |
| Menu‑bar **ear** | `tray.rs` `toggle_session` + `lib.rs` listener | compiles; live toggle via CLI/tray | High |
| **Dual‑stream meeting capture** | `session.rs` `start_sources`/`finalize_session`, `mix_tracks` | **live row 19** (Steve Jobs talk): mic="Me" + system="Speaker 1", merged, accurate transcript | High |
| **Bleed de‑dup** (`drop_bleed`) | `diarization.rs` | **live row 23**: same speaker‑bleed scenario → collapsed to a single speaker, transcript once; 3 unit tests | High |
| Startup **self‑healing** | `history.rs` `fail_stale_transcribing()` | unit‑tested; wired before `recover_interrupted` | High |
| **Local MCP server** (Claude bridge) | `handy/mcp/`, `.mcp.json` | **verified live against the real `history.db`** (returned rows 11/12 + diarized meetings); 4 tests + JSON‑RPC smoke | High |
| Bundled diarization models | `resources/models/diarization/` | auto‑install on first run → offline | High |
| Release binary | `tauri build --no-bundle` | built clean, 36 MB | High |
| **History session‑card result view** | `HistorySettings.tsx` | source icon (meeting/mic/system/dictation) · topic title · date·duration·source meta · speaker chips · collapsible timeline + player + actions | High (live‑validated 2026‑06‑23) |
| Menu‑bar **"ear"** listening signal | `tray.rs` `TrayIconState::Listening` + `resources/tray_listening.png` | icon flips to an ear whenever a session records (any route); dictation keeps the dot | High |
| **Auto‑capture engine** (brain + shell) | `managers/auto_capture.rs` | pure `AutoCaptureDecider` (6 unit tests) + supervisor with probation/discard/cooldown/manual‑respect | High |
| **Per‑process auto‑capture trigger** | `audio_toolkit/audio/output_sensor.rs` | `ProcessObjectList` + `IsRunningOutput`, own PID excluded; 4 unit + 2 live‑acceptance tests; **full E2E live 2026‑07‑05** (afplay → auto‑start ≈1.4 s → probation ok → auto‑finalize, `history.db` row 79 `done`) | High (synthetic audio; real‑meeting run pending) |
| **End‑to‑end hardening pass** (2026‑07‑05, two passes) | whole stack — see `docs/HANDOFF-HARDENING.md` | every review finding closed; tests **106→156 Rust + 4→13 MCP green**; key behavior changes: bounded‑RAM finalize (stream‑mix from disk, one track resident, PCMs die on finalize success + recovery "WAV exists → cleanup only"), DI'd finalize (`Transcriber`/`SessionSink` seams, stub‑tested), grouped crash recovery (`plan_recovery`, dual crash = one session), pure `Supervisor::tick` (muted‑meeting churn fixed, silent sessions cancelled never finalized), recorder stop/close deadlock fixed, derived tray state, WAL, migration #7 `source` column, `session_elapsed_ms`, batched `get_session_overviews` (History N+1 gone) | High (unit/protocol‑tested; auto‑capture real‑meeting run still pending) |

> **The one bug the tests did NOT catch (now fixed):** a **start‑path deadlock** — `start_sources` emitted `SessionStateChanged` while holding the `active` mutex; the listener runs *inline* and re‑enters the manager (`change_tray_icon` → `update_tray_menu` → `is_active()`), re‑locking the non‑reentrant mutex. Fixed by `drop(guard)` before `emit`. See §6.1. Found by adversarial review; the unit tests never traverse the emit→listener path. **Lesson: drop the lock before emitting any event whose listener may re‑enter the manager.**
> **2026‑07‑05 addendum:** the hardening pass found the *mirror* class of that bug family — a stop/close **deadlock** in the recorder when the device stalls (commands starved behind a blocking sample `recv`), an **event‑ordering race** on the same emit path (fixed by re‑reading `is_active()` at emit time), and a **data‑loss window** in finalize (PCMs deleted before the WAV existed). All regression‑tested now; full forensics in `docs/HANDOFF-HARDENING.md`.

---

## 4. Control surface (the API you'll extend)

| Kind | Name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command | `start_session(source)` | single source (`"Mic"` / `"SystemAudio"`) |
| Command | `start_meeting()` | **dual** mic + system (the ear's action) |
| Command | `stop_session()` · `is_session_active()` | |
| Command | `get_session_segments(id)` · `download_diarization_models` · `is_diarization_available` | |
| Event | `session-state-changed` | `{ active, source }` → drives UI + tray icon (single source of truth) |
| Event | `history-update-payload` | `added`/`updated`/`deleted`/`toggled` (binding key `historyUpdatePayload`) |
| CLI flag | `--toggle-session` / `--toggle-system-session` / `--toggle-meeting` | single mic / single system / dual. Plus upstream `--toggle-transcription` (dictation), `--cancel`, etc. |
| Setting | `auto_capture_enabled` | opt‑in gate for the seamless auto‑capture supervisor (default `false`; flip only after a real‑meeting validation) |

All session routes converge on `SessionManager`. CLI flags forward to a **running** primary via the single‑instance plugin (`lib.rs`); with no primary they boot a new instance and silently ignore the flag (see §6.4). Commands/events are typed through `tauri-specta` into `src/bindings.ts` (regenerated on dev startup).

---

## 5. Data model — `history.db` (SQLite, `rusqlite_migration`, append‑only)

Migrations: #1 base `transcription_history`; #2–#4 post‑process columns; #5 the diarization overlay; **#6 the `status` column**. **Never edit a shipped migration** (corrupts the `user_version` chain) — append a new one.

```sql
transcription_history(
  id, file_name, timestamp, saved, title, transcription_text,
  post_processed_text, post_process_prompt, post_process_requested,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'done'        -- 'transcribing' | 'done' | 'failed'
)
speakers(id, history_id→transcription_history ON DELETE CASCADE, label, embedding)
   -- label = "Me" (mic) or "Speaker N" (diarized), per history row
transcription_segments(
  id, history_id→ ON DELETE CASCADE, speaker_id→speakers ON DELETE SET NULL,
  start_ms, end_ms, text, confidence)
CREATE INDEX idx_segments_history ON transcription_segments(history_id);
```
- The flat `transcription_text` is the canonical transcript; `speakers`+`transcription_segments` are the speaker‑attributed overlay. `ON DELETE CASCADE` needs `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` per connection (`get_connection` sets it).
- `write_segments` uses **two independent speaker namespaces** in the one `speakers` table: explicit `speaker_label` (e.g. `"Me"`, deduped by string) and diarizer indices (deduped by id → `"Speaker N"`), so "Me" never renumbers the remote speakers.

---

## 6. Critical engineering lessons & traps (read before touching the pipeline)

**6.1 — Drop the lock before emitting a re‑entrant event.** `SessionStateChanged::listen` (in `lib.rs`) runs **inline on the emitting thread** and re‑enters the manager — `change_tray_icon` → `update_tray_menu` → `is_active()` — which re‑locks the non‑reentrant `std::sync::Mutex`. `start_sources` therefore `drop(guard)`s *before* `emit`. `stop()` is safe because it `.take()`s the guard first. Mirror this for any new manager event.

**6.2 — Speaker bleed on laptop speakers (the doubled transcript).** A meeting played through **speakers** (not headphones) is re‑captured by the mic, so one remote person appears as both `Me` and `Speaker N`. `drop_bleed` (`diarization.rs`) drops a `"Me"` segment when an overlapping other‑speaker segment has ≥70% word overlap (= echo); genuine distinct mic speech is kept. **This is transcript‑level only — the echo is still in the mixed WAV.** The real fix is acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) on the mic input (named ceiling, §11). Headphones avoid it; **System** mode (no mic) is correct for pure listening. *(riffado offers nothing here — it has no audio capture; this is ours, see DECISIONS.md.)*

**6.3 — The ASR model must be RESIDENT at `finalize`, and `finalize` will not load it.** Diarization+transcription run only when `is_model_loaded()`. The model **unloads on its idle timer**; a long gap before capturing yields an empty (but `done`) row. To warm it you must run a transcription **with audio actually playing** (silence is VAD‑discarded and won't load the model). Keep `unload_timeout ≠ Immediately`, or warm with one dictation while audio plays. *(This cost real time during testing — empty rows looked like a bug but were a cold model.)*

**6.4 — The CLI toggle needs a running primary.** `handy --toggle-meeting` (etc.) only work as a *second* instance forwarding to a live `bun tauri dev`; with no primary they boot their own instance and ignore the flag (symptom: no `*.session.pcm`).

**6.5 — Capture taps the default output at session start.** System audio routed to headphones/Bluetooth or muted → the tap records silence → empty transcript (graceful, not a bug). Verify you can hear the captured output.

**6.6 — Bindings export is dev‑only & non‑fatal** (logs and continues on a read‑only CWD). **Migrations are append‑only.** **i18n is build‑blocking** (ESLint errors on literal JSX strings; add keys to `src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`, others fall back to English; the tray's `TrayStrings` are auto‑generated by `build.rs` from the English `tray` block).

**6.7 — Never gate auto‑capture on the device‑level "running" flag.** `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere` reads perpetually true from inside this app once our tap has ever been opened (proved live: 17/17 idle auto‑starts were empty). The fix is the **per‑process sensor** (`output_sensor.rs`: `kAudioHardwarePropertyProcessObjectList` + `kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningOutput`, own PID excluded) — and **probation stays** as the second net. START and STOP use different signals on purpose: START = per‑process sensor; STOP = captured‑audio silence (a meeting app keeps its output stream open while nobody talks, so "app is outputting" can't end a call).

**6.8 — A settings field takes two edits:** the `#[serde(default)]` attribute *and* the explicit field in `get_default_settings()` (`settings.rs` ~line 787) — forgetting the second ships wrong defaults on fresh installs.

---

## 7. Security posture (the local‑first contract)

- **No network egress for data.** ASR + diarization run on‑device (ONNX). The MCP server speaks **stdio only — no listener, no socket, no fetch** (grep‑verified). The "nothing leaves the Mac" promise holds end‑to‑end.
- **MCP is read‑only.** `new Database(path, { readonly: true })` — it physically cannot alter a recording. Every query is **parameterized** (`?` placeholders); table/column names are static literals; tool args become bound params or integer limits only → **no SQL injection**, no path traversal (DB path is fixed or `PLAUDE_DB` env, never a tool arg).
- **macOS permissions:** system‑audio capture uses the **Audio‑Recording TCC permission** (`NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription`), *not* Screen Recording → no purple banner. Mic uses the standard mic permission.
- **No secrets in the repo or DB today.** If a cloud LLM key is ever added, use the macOS Keychain or AES‑GCM at rest (see DECISIONS.md §Encryption) — do **not** store plaintext.
- **Audio files** live unencrypted in `recordings/`; the DB is unencrypted (single‑user, on‑device). At‑rest DB encryption is an *optional* future, not a multi‑tenant requirement.

---

## 8. File inventory (our delta on upstream Handy)

**New:** `managers/session.rs` (long‑form + dual capture), `audio_toolkit/audio/system_audio.rs` (CoreAudio tap), `managers/diarization.rs` (`align`/`label_segments`/`merge_segments`/`drop_bleed` + `DiarizationManager`), `managers/auto_capture.rs` (seamless auto‑capture brain + supervisor), `audio_toolkit/audio/output_sensor.rs` (per‑process trigger sensor), `commands/session.rs`, `resources/models/diarization/*.onnx`, `resources/tray_listening.png` (the ear), **`handy/mcp/{db,server}.ts,db.test.ts,package.json,README.md}`**, **`.mcp.json`** (repo root), `src/components/settings/sessions/SessionsSettings.tsx`.

**Modified (key):** `managers/history.rs` (migrations #5/#6, status, dual‑namespace `write_segments`, `save_pending_entry`, `fail_stale_transcribing`), `managers/transcription.rs` (`transcribe_with_segments`), `managers/model.rs` (diarization download + bundle), `tray.rs` (the ear), `lib.rs` (wiring, listener, `--toggle-meeting`, `start_meeting`, startup self‑heal), `cli.rs`, `audio_toolkit/audio/recorder.rs` (`with_chunk_sink`), `commands/history.rs`, `components/settings/history/HistorySettings.tsx` (timeline + speaker chips + status states), `Sidebar.tsx`, `i18n/locales/{en,it}/translation.json`, `Cargo.toml`/`.cargo/config.toml`/`build.rs`/`Info.plist`, `src/bindings.ts` (regenerated). Full table in [CODEBASE.md §11](CODEBASE.md).

## 9. Verification procedures (re‑prove any claim)

```bash
# Backend + MCP correctness
cd handy/src-tauri && cargo check --lib && cargo test --lib   # 102 passed (+2 ignored)
cd ../mcp && bun test                                          # 4 pass
cd ../ && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun run lint                    # clean

# AUTO-CAPTURE sensor live acceptance (no app needed; machine should be quiet):
#   cargo test --lib output_sensor -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
#   → live_own_tap_open_does_not_trigger  (the 17/17-false-starts regression, must stay false)
#   → live_external_afplay_triggers       (external process playing → true)

# AUTO-CAPTURE full E2E (synthetic, deterministic — how it was validated 2026-07-05):
#   1) back up settings_store.json; set settings.auto_capture_enabled=true
#   2) ./target/debug/handy --start-hidden   (background)
#   3) stay quiet ~5s (expect NO trigger) → loop afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff ~8s
#   4) log expects: "system audio detected → session started (probation)" → "real audio confirmed"
#      → (after ~4s silence) "speakers quiet → session finalized"; new history row status 'done'
#   5) kill app FIRST, then restore settings (the store flushes on exit and would overwrite)

# LIVE dual meeting capture (deterministic, no headphones needed — uses macOS `say`):
#   1) bun tauri dev running; an ASR model resident.
#   2) WARM the model WITH audio playing (silence won't load it):
#      ./target/debug/handy --toggle-transcription; say "warming the model"; ./target/debug/handy --toggle-transcription ; sleep 22
#   3) CAPTURE:
#      ./target/debug/handy --toggle-meeting; say "the quarterly numbers look strong"; ./target/debug/handy --toggle-meeting ; sleep 30
#   4) INSPECT (expect ONE speaker "Speaker 1", text once — bleed de-duped):
#      sqlite3 -readonly ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.uppify.plaudy/history.db \
#        "SELECT label FROM speakers WHERE history_id=(SELECT max(id) FROM transcription_history);"
#   With real human speech on a real call + headphones: expect "Me" (you) AND the remote "Speaker N", cleanly separated.

# LIVE MCP (what Claude sees) — see §1.4.
```
> Cleaning up test rows: the app's History trash icon, or delete `id > <your last real id>` from `transcription_history` (+ their `transcription_segments`/`speakers` and the `recordings/*.wav`).

## 10. Repo / git state

- **Remote:** `github.com/uppifyagency/plaudy` (private), branch `main`. The upstream `handy/.git` was **flattened** into this single repo (upstream = `cjpais/Handy`).
- **Working tree is NOT committed** — this session's work (dual capture, the tray ear, MCP, status column, bleed de‑dup, self‑heal, docs) is staged in the tree only. **Commit/push only when the user asks.** End commit messages with the `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer; branch off `main` first if needed.
- **Models are committed** (`resources/models/diarization/*.onnx`, ~46 MB); `git config http.postBuffer 524288000` is set locally for the large push. `.gitignore` excludes `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and stray `*.onnx` loose in `src-tauri/`.
- `handy/mcp/` has **no `node_modules`** (dependency‑free) — nothing to install.

---

## 11. What's PENDING / DEFERRED (prioritized)

1. **Auto‑capture: real‑meeting validation → consider flipping the default.** The trigger is fixed and E2E‑validated with synthetic audio (2026‑07‑05, see [HANDOFF-AUTOCAPTURE.md](HANDOFF-AUTOCAPTURE.md)). Run one real Zoom/Meet call with `auto_capture_enabled=true` (expect auto‑start, "Me"+"Speaker N" transcript, auto‑finalize), then decide the default. Optional refinement: an **app allowlist** via `kAudioProcessPropertyBundleID` (one more property read in `output_sensor.rs`) so only meeting apps trigger.
2. **Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC).** `drop_bleed` removes the transcript *duplicate*; the echo is still in the mixed WAV and the mic still hears the speakers. Real AEC (subtract the system reference from the mic in `recorder.rs`/`session.rs`) is the proper fix for clean speaker use. Headphones sidestep it today.
3. **"Enable diarization" download button** in the Sessions view (command exists; bundling already covers fresh clones, so it's a fallback).
4. **AI topic‑title & summary — via MCP (decision RESOLVED 2026‑07‑05, see §12).** No local LLM sidecar: the user's/client's agents call the local MCP (`get_session`) and produce title/summary on demand with their own subscription. Card titles keep the non‑AI placeholder (transcript opening words) until/unless an agent‑written title persistence path is wanted — that would need a deliberate, tiny write surface (MCP is read‑only by contract; see §7).
5. **Signed/notarized `.app`/`.dmg`** — release *binary* builds; the bundle needs **full Xcode**.
6. **iPhone target (needs full Xcode).** No iOS upstream. Recommended: **iPhone‑as‑capture + Mac‑as‑brain** over Apple's nearby transfer — a SwiftUI app records locally and, on proximity, pushes files (MultipeerConnectivity, or Network.framework peer‑to‑peer Bonjour) into the Mac's `recordings/` dir, where the existing `recover_interrupted`/finalize pipeline ingests them chronologically.
7. **Clustering threshold tuning** — only if a rapid‑alternation recording over‑merges speakers (defaults are good for long‑turn audio). Lever: `OfflineSpeakerDiarizationConfig` in `diarization.rs`.

---

## 12. Open decisions (need a human call — do NOT guess)

- ~~**AI provider stance**~~ **RESOLVED (Vlad, 2026‑07‑05): the local MCP is the AI path.** Client/user agents interrogate the transcription and produce summary/title on the fly with the user's own subscription. Explicitly **no local LLM sidecar** (Meetily's `llama-helper` pattern was evaluated end‑to‑end and rejected). No provider abstraction, no `ai_enhancements` table, no keys — nothing to encrypt.
- **When to flip `auto_capture_enabled` default to `true`:** after the real‑meeting validation (§11.1). Product call — includes the privacy stance (system‑audio trigger only; bare‑mic auto‑record stays separate opt‑in).
- **Encryption key management** (only once a secret exists — none today, and none planned after the MCP decision): macOS Keychain (recommended) vs passphrase‑derived (Argon2), or defer.
- **Bleed strategy:** ship AEC, or treat "use headphones / System mode" as the documented answer and keep `drop_bleed` as the safety net?
- **Webhooks / local automation surface** (fire `session.ended` to n8n/Obsidian) — build, or YAGNI until asked?
- **Commit cadence** — the tree is uncommitted by design; ask before committing.

---

## 13. Conventions (enforced — respect them)

- **Ponytail is active (level: full).** Lazy‑senior‑dev: YAGNI → stdlib → native → existing dep → one line → minimum. Never cut validation, error handling, security, accessibility. Mark intentional shortcuts with a `ponytail:` comment naming the ceiling + upgrade path. Toggle: `/ponytail lite|full|ultra|off`.
- **Agile technical practices** are the working method: thin vertical slices, **outside‑in/TDD** (pure domain logic — `align`/`merge_segments`/`drop_bleed`/`mix_tracks` — is tested in isolation), stay green, refactor under green, **adversarial review before declaring done** (it caught the deadlock).
- **Extend Handy's managers/pipeline; cite the real `handy/src-tauri/...` file** when proposing changes. Prefer the producer‑agnostic `chunk_sink` seam over net‑new capture paths.
- **Single source of truth for diarization filenames:** `DiarizationManager::{SUBDIR,SEG_FILE,EMB_FILE}`.
- **nWave** waves/agents available for backend/architecture work.
